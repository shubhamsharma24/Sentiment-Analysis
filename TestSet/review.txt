>>BUYERS BE WARE, there are many versions of this phone, the US at&t version is a 16 GB version, people unlock it via an unlock code and sell it as an unlocked international version, the international one has 32 GB & comes without the at&t logo on the front. The one on this page is the 16 GB one, the 32 GB will cost a bit more and you need to write in search "32 GB One X", remember this phone has no slot for an external SD card, so more internal storage may be crucial for some!&lt;&lt;<br /><br />----Original review----<br />I used so many brands and models of phones and smartphones than I can remember, and this one here, except for the memory card thing, covers every hole that was in every other phone I used. It also covers any thing u may have thought of having in a phone, and it is doing that in style! I tried the Samsung Galaxy S3 at at&t before choosing the One x, and it really isn't better. I mean it is just about personal preferences, I always feel Samsung phones ( not all Samsung products, I love their TVs for example)have a cheap felling. Besides I liked how the One X looked more than the S3.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Amazing screen, and I am coming from a Motorola Droid Razr which has a very good screen itself. The screen here is sharper,  colors are better, no shadows(Razr had a green shadow on all colors. Watching Youtube or any vids on this phone is a thing I long for throughout the day!<br />-Battery life is good enough for a full day with moderate use. Of course excessive movie watching, game playing or hours long web surfing require a twice chraging.<br />-The 8 MP Camera deserves all the fuzz it received when first introduced, its pictures are steady, colors are vivid and quality is really high!<br />-Speed: The phone handles multitasking very well, games and videos are a breath nothing you should worry about here.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this phone, which is why I would say it is more like 4.5 stars not 5, is the lack of a memory card slot. I mean, seriously? it has a 2 year free subscription for extra storage online and everything, but whyyy?? How hard was it to add an extra slot for a memory card? An engineer's mistake without any doubt.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want an Android phone go for the One X or the S3, can't make up your mind, try them both and just pick any of them you will end up with a winner either way!<br /><br />-----UPDATE------<br />So I was tempted to get the S3 since I have a month to exchange the phone with at&t and I wanted to know how better was the S3. I got the blue S3 and I certainly loved it, it doesn't feel cheap in hand as I expected, but it feels rather classy and here are my thoughts in comparison, I hope this experience may help other people decide:<br />- The S3 overall look is really slick, it is ofcourse all about personal preferences as I said before, but sometime I wished that the One X looked more like the blue S3! the metal edges gave it some superiority no doubt about that, the blue finish was really good, but the white looks really cheap, don't think about it!<br />- The Samsung motions( swipe to take a screen shot, raise the phone up to your ears with an open message to automatically dial the sender without pressing any keys & others) are really cool and are certainly a point above the OneX.<br />- Sd card slot, as basic as it is , it is better than not having one!<br />But that is it, these are the only things where the S3 bests the OneX<br />- The Svoice(Smamsung reply to iPhone's Siri) Is totally useless, and certainly needs more development, a good idea that may get better in newer models, but not a plus for the S3, not to mention it consumes more battery when turned on.<br />- The screen is different than the one X, I can't totally explain it, not the pixels density but mainly the colors. As I read online it looks like Samsung forgot to calibrate its screens, so as good as they are colors don't look natural. And you can't really feel it unless u spent some time with the OneX's gorgeous screen, colors aren't as vibrant or bright, a picture of a clear sea looks darker, less vivid and less colorful on the S3 than the One X and though really good, the One X is considerably better.<br />- The camera is good, but again the One X's camera is definitely better both outdoor & indoor, may be not by much but the difference is definitely there.<br />- Eye tracking: It was supposed to prevent the screen from sleeping when you are reading or surfing, well it doesn't do the job very well. In low light situations it is pretty much useless, since it depends on the front camera for eye tracking. In regular light it was ok, but again u had to hold to hold the phone in a certain way to make sure it "sees" your eye! I didn't find it that impressive..or useful!<br />- Speed:same for both<br />- Samsung's touchWiz vs htc Sense is an even battle I liked them both.<br />- Battery: both are almost the same battery wise, though moderate to heavy use will definitely require a twice per day charging with both of them, you may be able to get enough juice till you get back home. Actually light use easily gets you through the day.<br />Of course you can buy an extra battery with the S3 and swipe batteries cos the one X has a built in battery which the user can't replace on his own, but again you can buy a charging case for the oneX!<br />Both have NFC which I didn't use in the ~ Two weeks period with each phone.<br /><br />-------Conclusion-------<br />If you want a better screen and camera definitely go with the oneX, you will regret you didn't go with it when you see one in comparison with the S3!<br />If you are a media fanatic who needs a lot of space, the the OneX isn't for u, the S3 is as good as a phone, even with a lower screen but with extra micro SD card slot. Also if you like to impress your friends, the little Samsung motions are certainly impressive and fun to use and the overall look may be a bit better.<br /><br />WHAT DID I DO?<br />I missed how great the OneX screen was, I certainly missed how awesome HD vids looked on the screen, also I missed the slightly better camera, so I gladly paid the $35 restocking fee for at&t and again returned back to the OneX, black this time since the white one caught stains fairly easily and had to be cleaned from time to time! I sold the at&t over eBay and bought the unlocked international version with 32 GB built in memory, which was a bit more expensive but was definitely worth it!


I purchased this phone for my husband so we didn't have to extend our AT&T contract. I paid a premium price for this phone, the same as a new one from AT&T and I expected to get a new phone. What we received was a previously sold and returned refurbished phone at a new phone price.<br /><br />I gave the phone to my husband on Christmas morning unknown that it was a refurb. My husband suspected it wasn't new due to cosmetic marks on it and when he went to the AT&T store to activate it they confirmed it had been previously sold and was returned under warranty due to a defect.<br /><br />Fast forward 3 weeks. My husband has had the phone and it has worked for the most part. It did have some glitches with freezing up at times and taking a long time to finally ring when he tried to make a call. Wireless also would lock on to a network and wouldn't let go even after leaving that network area so he would have to manually turn wifi off to get it to connect to the mobile network....  Very aggravating for a $500 phone.<br /><br />My husband put his phone on charge last night and turned it off as he normally does... This morning he takes it off charge and tried to power it up...Nothing!  He spent the next hour trying to get it to boot up.....Nothing!<br />He then takes it up to AT&T and they try several different things to get it to boot up....NOTHING! the phone is completely dead after only 3 weeks of ownership.<br /><br />My husband is livid I spent $500+ on this phone and the fact he now has NO PHONE.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!


Let's clear up some confusion about this phone.<br /><br />1.  Is this the international version, or the US version?<br /><br />This phone IS the international version.  It is actually the HTC One XL, or Evita model.  The US only version is NOT sold in white, and is the Endeavor model.  How do I know this?  Because I bought two of these phones used, white, from a private seller.  They have the AT&T stamp above the screen.  But I root my phones and upgrade them with custom ROMs.  In the process of rooting and upgrading these, I realize that my phones only accept the Evita version of ROMs, which means that despite the AT&T logo, they are the international version.  AT&T simply had some of these ordered with their logo so they could offer more in-store color options.  This can be confusing, but it's just a logo, it doesn't necessarily mean the hardware inside the phone is different.  Relax and buy on!  Of course, I can't speak for the sellers on here if they sell you a phone in a lesser state than they guarantee, so if you get a phone that is less than promised, contact the seller to correct it, and if needed, file a complaint with Amazon.<br /><br />2.  Dual core, or quad core?<br /><br />I see some grumbling about how many cores the processor in this phone actually has.  I personally have never seen the base model of these phones for sale with a quad core processor.  The International (XL) and US versions (X) of this phone both advertise dual core processors on Amazon.  I wouldn't get too hung up on the processor speed though.  With 1 GB of RAM, these phones are screaming fast, and can easily keep pace with pretty much any other phone on the market in day to day tasks. If you really, really want a quad core HTC phone, search for and get the S720E One X 32 GB or S728E One X+.  They are upgrades on the hardware level.  They look basically the same, but offer a quad core processor and larger storage capacities.<br /><br />3.  16 GB storage?  32 GB?  How much storage space do these phones really have?<br /><br />The original HTC One X and One XL only offer 16 GB of storage.  HTC also offered a refreshed version with a 32 GB option and quad core processor.  There is also the S728E One X+, which offers a whopping 64 GB of storage.  You have to search specifically for the S720E 32 GB or S728E if you want the closest thing to the phone sold here but with greater storage capacity.  But as far as the base version One XL sold here, it is only 16 GB.<br /><br />4. Wait a minute.  I bought this phone as a 16 GB model, but total storage space according to the operating system is only 12 GB.  Why?<br /><br />HTC adds an extra layer of security to their phones called "S-on", or Security On.  Their is a partition within the flash storage on the phone that houses sensitive firmware-related and hardware-related files, and this occupies the missing 4 GB of space.  Security On protects this partition from intrusion, as tampering with it could result in an unusable phone, AKA a "bricked" device.  So, don't panic.  HTC actually does us a favor by shielding us from these files.  This 4 GB of missing space is absolutely essential for the phone to operate normally.  Just be aware of this before you purchase.  If you need a phone that offers more space, I suggest finding an equivalent phone with an SD card slot, or purchasing the S720E 32 GB or S728E.<br /><br />5. My battery life isn't all that great.  How can I improve it?<br /><br />For the less adventurous types out there, the easiest way to regain some battery life is to disable unnecessary apps.  HTC and AT&T like to install a bunch of applications that the majority of us simply won't use.  So we call that "bloatware".  To disable the apps, navigate to Settings, Apps, All and select the AT&T or HTC apps you want off.  Force Stop the app, then Disable it.  For those who are computer savvy and have rooted before, I recommend unlocking your bootloader, installing Clockworkmod recovery, and then installing Superuser SU and Root App Delete from the Play store.  These apps will allow you to delete the HTC and AT&T software altogether.  A Permanent fix would be to go one step further and install a custom ROM (operating system) on your phone.  This will give you a clean operating system with no HTC or AT&T apps.  There are tutorials at XDA-Developers forum on how to perform all of these tasks.  To get your phone's bootloader unlocked and start the process, search for "HTC Dev" in your search engine of choice, and you will find HTC's developer website that takes you step by step through the unlock process.  Your bootloader has to be unlocked to install a recovery and root your phone.<br /><br />6.  My personal thoughts on this phone<br /><br />My family is very satisfied with these phones.  They are fast, capable, and despite the S-On feature, have adequate storage for our media needs.  The screens are sharp, pictures are fantastic, and keeping up with friends on social media is pleasurable on this phone.  We almost prefer the phones to our desktop computers when it comes to social media.  The battery life is great once rooted and cleaned up.  I love showing them off to my friends with iPhones, because let's face it, they are as capable as the iPhone 4 with the right apps installed and for less money in many cases.  I would recommend them to a friend, pending they take my advice on disabling or removing unnecessary apps.


the HTC one x is truly an awesome super phone, It's really smooth and very speedy with no lags. the built quality is excellent, the camera is superb. the screen is really great has true colors and excellent viewing angles. and the tegra zone optimized games for tegra 3 are really awesome, excellent graphics the best for android when optimized with tegra 3. I am not to crazy about HTC sense kind of slows phone a bit sometimes, I added apex launcher and let me tell you this phone is super fast with this launcher. my previous phones iPhone 4s and Samsung galaxy note were great phones, but can't touch the HTC one x.


This is the at&t version of one x. It has a dual core processor unlike the quad-core processor of famous one x. Moreover at&t disabled many handy menu items  such as transfer (to transfer old phone's memo). Finally the is no ear phones in the box.<br /> So be careful when buying this item and don't confuse it with the known one x model


its not one X .it is one XL..better correct it.....it is very confusing and misleading for consumer,i want tegra3 and bought it wrong.


The description shows its an unlocked piece. I have received AT&T release model. Also, it seems to me that the phone is not new.


Sound quality while calling is very poor, need to use earphone . Also the phone gets heated up when we use simple applications as well, also after you charged the phone. When i googled i saw people having same problems. I just found out , one of my colleauge had literally exchanged this phone from the carrier 4 times. So HTC has real bad problem with this phone.


when i got this phone i was confused since i put my sim card in and it said it was locked i called up the seller and he told me the unlock code was in the front of the box... it was a pretty dumb mistake on my part for not checking the box but they were very friendly and the phone works great now1


This phone arrived in an AT&T box.  Upon putting in my T-mobile sim card into the phone, the phone would not work. I contacted both T-mobile and AT&T and was told the phone was not unlocked.  I contacted the seller, who stated they must have had a bad shipment come in.  Amazon was very good about returning my money.


I bought this product as gift for someone else for another country. Now I realized is dual-core and the phone is getting stuck and it has apps that are annoying from AT&T.<br /><br />Don't buy this product from this retailer.


When I bought this phone, it was posted as &#34;new&#34;. However, when it came in the mail, you could tell that it was not new. The phone was worn, and the screen was already beginning to come off. Also, there were chips in the hardware. Lastly, this phone was an international model, so the most internet i ever got was 2G, or Edge. I was not satisfied at all. The phone is already broken because it will not turn on even though I just bought it a month ago, and I am not exaggerating.


You should note that the 16GB is not all storage, it's partitioned and 6GB can only be used for ap storage. It's also stuffed to the gill with ATT bloatware and it will not pic message on straight talk.<br /><br />The merchant was fines, shipping great... phone is just soso


This cellphone is that kind of phone that we usually are looking for in Venezuela: nice, fast, cheap and very helpful. I recommend it at all.


The battery on this phone stopped staying charged after only 2 months of owning it and would only stay charged for about 6 hours.  Yesterday, it completely stopped working. I have only had it 3 months. The screen is falling off and became totally un-calibrated. NOT worth your money.


I have had the phone for a couple of weeks now and works perfectly. I am using it outside the USA without any trouble, it was unlocked and ready for a new sim card to be put in. It's a good sized phone, my 4yearold is having a great time playing on it. However it is to big to carry in your pants if that is something you consider necessary. Great colors on screen, good sound, awesome price. Battery life is normal, if you use your phone all die (playing videogames or using apps), then battery will die, but I think that is normal. All in all I love the phone, Im very happy I bought it.


My gosh i think its a bit more than expected, its more than a cell phone. I must say it was unlocked made a call as soon as i fitted my sim. Great i am thinking of getting another.


The only detail is that the vendor doesn't mention that it comes with att logo, but it works perfectly and it's a really nice phone


HTC One X is indeed an amazing phone, and it is unlocked as described. What's misleading about the description from this Seller (Tablet Distribuitor) is that this phone is an AT&T unlocked phone. Meaning it comes with all AT&T Software that is useless if you want to use it with another carrier.<br />I've read in many other reviews claiming that this phone is not unlocked because it's from ATT&T. That's not true, you just need to enter APN values for your carrier.


Nice phone! No problems, exactly what I wanted. Clear sound, lots of gadgets! Does every thing I needed and more!


This is truly a lovely android phone. The touch screen is very responsive...I can't find anything to complain about. Oh, maybe the charger, its tricky.


I like this phone,Good!!!<br />I have unlocked the bootload ,and use the 3th ROMs<br />it's fast,the GPS is good<br />it's better then sansung galaxy s3


This phone was basically brand new. I received it within one day. That's all there is to say. I give it five stars for the service and the condition the phone was in. If you see MOBILE IMAGE and your looking for the best bang for your buck. Give that buck to them. You'll be satisfied


Great phone and camera.It's unlocked but no manual adjustment for the 3G network because it's a AT&T software inside,so its only good for networks whose network operator don't need manual settings.I can only use wi-fi until I put the original software from HTC.That's the reason why i give 4 stars.


i got this phone as a gift for my wife. she loved it so much! to be honest with you, I found it really amazing and that was the first android phone i ever used. the two things that caught my attention is the screen resolution and the audio quality. the screen resolution is stunning, it has a nice contrast and visuals, colors are nicer than other phones. the audio system by Beats is really good. i was surprised why the phone doesn't come with a Beats earphones. all in all, really good phone! would totally recommend it for others.


I made the trade in and shipped it on the 7th, It said they recived it on the 13th and today is the 21st and still no money from the trade in or even given the phone back. I've even contacted amazon 3 times and each time they say they cant do enything. So pretty much i think i got scammed


This is the AT&T version. It clearly has att logo on it. This means the phone has only 2 cores and 16 GB. The overally quality is alright. Run benchmark under Antutu, the score is ok.


I love everything about this phone, but I am having one major issue with it.  The slot where the sim card goes apparently has a manufacturing defect.  My sim card loses connectivity and then shows no sim, therefore, no phone service.  This happened on the first HTC One X I got, (which was only a couple of weeks after purchase) so I went back got a replacement. Well, a couple of weeks into this phone and the same thing is happening again! It is very annoying as I do not know when it happens till I look at my phone. I cannot receive calls when this happens or text.  I am wondering if I should go and try another replacement HTC One X again, or try to get another phone completely to replace it. Has anyone else had this problem?


I got the AT&T version and loved it for quite a few months. Then, the other day, 6 months out of warranty, it completely died. I was not the best at saving pictures and I'm afraid I've lost everything. I am now shopping for another phone but I won't be buying another HTC or any phone without a removable card and battery.


very good cellphone indeed. but I didn't know it was doble core, but anyway i liked it. it worked good, had no scratches on it. I'm from Venezuela-Valencia


I had to send it back for a refund when it stopped working the first day I had it. These phones have an obvious design flaw, the battery craps out on them real quick. Got a refund so the customer service was excellent but I am disappointed. Got an lg g2 instead. No regrets.


It did not work with Straight talk, I could make calls but this phone would not send or receive  pics, it wouldnt access maps either. I sent it back within a few days, once I knew phone was set up correctly.


Ordered this phone for straight talk, cannot use it for straight talk unless I have att service for three months because the phone is NOT unlocked. They won't replace, only refund, so it is a waste of time.


Buy this phone and the headset is not listening.<br /><br />Very poor quality control.<br /><br />I'm in process of return.<br /><br />First time a HTC does not work me fine.


First off, amazon can't ship phones overnight, even though they give u the option. I paid for overnight shipping and didn't get it for two days, they did give me shipping costs back however.<br />Now to the phone, mine was shipped through Amazon and the phone box was very dirty and it said it was a new phone but looked like someone with dirty hands put shipping tape all over the box. Wasn't factory sealed. So I'm not so sure it was brand new as stated.<br />The phone looked nice but when I turned it on, everything was in Spanish. It had Spanish contacts already installed, booklet enclosed in Spanish, and the bookmarks. Some websites won't work right saying it doesn't recognize the system I'm using. Even though I installed chrome. Not sure why.<br />The good:<br />Screen is perfect size, not too big. Graphics look great. Really good colors. Really like this phone overall, especiallyfor the price. First time using any phone other than Motorola.<br />The company amazon got this from was H&M I Believe was their name. Guess I should've asked if this was an AT&T or American based phone, other than that not having any problems after 2 weeks.<br />UPDATE:<br />after having problems not being able to connect to some websites and being kicked off websites, and google search looks different than normal, I called HTC and they said these we're made for the Brazilian market. Which explains the Spanish contacts and language when I first got it. These are not made to work perfect with north America. So there are things that won't work right. If you're in Brazil this is probably a great phone....not so much in the USA.


I've had this phone for about 8 months now, and I honestly am disappointed with the shape its in,considering how great I have taken care of it. It crashes constantly, and is always getting too hot to touch that I have to let it cool off for awhile, even when I've hardly been using it. It's supposed to be factory unlocked even when I changed the APN settings for the phone, I had no internet connection or any service unless I was using AT&T.<br /><br />The phone worked great the first month or so that I had it, but after that it went downhill. It is also quite slow, even when it has plenty of storage/memory left.<br /><br />It is advertised as having Beats Audio, which only works when headphones are in, and you honestly can't tell a difference. The speakers are very quiet, and the phone constantly crashes when I'm trying to make or answer phone calls. Also, it does this annoying thing where it puts itself on vibrate/silent mode.<br /><br />Great buy if you're looking for a phone that will last a month tops!<br /><br />The only positive thing about the phone are the cameras.


Works good all but the speaker. Cant hear it at all. I would have liked to have known that up front..the beats audio is the main reason i bought it


This phone has given me nothing but headaches. It came with the screen slightly lifted from one side. I didn't return it because it was more of an aesthetic thing. From day one, the clicking sound from the power button wasn't smooth at all. Sometimes it would even get stuck. I didn't care that much until about 9 months of use, when I accidentally dropped it (from about a feet high): the power button didn't work anymore. I opened the phone CAREFULLY (major headache since it is tightly assembled) and figured that the button had lost a little rubber contact.  After "fixing" the phone (had to use the volume up button since the phone is pretty much useless without the power button) the mic just stopped working. Since the device has two mics, now I have to handle calls using the loudspeaker.<br /><br />My advice: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. As a matter of fact, DO NOT BUY HTC PHONES. I've had problems with other phones from the same brand. HTC is all about software; hardware is VERY low quality.


not served the phone, we can do? no vuelvo a comprar sin Garat&iacute;a , no me fij&eacute;. no v&iacute;! que no tenia, Dont see it!  &#34;FATAL&#34;


Para los que compran desde Venezuela, el producto es excelente y funciona a la perfecci&oacute;n. &iexcl;Recomendado!


This is perhaps the worst phone I have ever owned, don't get me wrong when it works it's great but then the camera goes out turns out that's a well known issue htc never got around to fixing along with the screen going out. Had it about 4 months before the screen went out completely still had sound, volume control, power but no display. I'm calling it done for after 4 months of owning it spending 250 bucks on this P.O.S. was an enormous waste. I also have a friend who has a DNA he's on his 5th due to software issues. DO NOT BUY HTC. I've just ordered a nexus 5 to replace this terrible waste of money, wish me luck and if in spite of my advice you do choose to buy this phone may god have mercy on your soul.


This is a great phone. The size is just perfect to read paper or books and it fits perfect in your pocket. It's fast and the screen is great. The only con is battery life


The product start to fail 3 weeks later of its purchase, I think was the seller and not the brand I got a HTC before and was really good.


Everything is great except for the BATTERY LIFE! I've used the phone for 4 days, in one day the phone died at 5pm and two days at 4pm... I really love the phone, and android, but I decided to switch back to apple since the poor battery life of ONE X. Although I'm sure that I'll be back with android someday but only when the battery can hold for a whole day.


I came from the Galaxy note, This is a decent phone, But I had some issues which I knew is to do with HTC as I have read a lot about screen ripple issues and Yellow warm screen tint. Did have a few data issues but nothing major. Besides all these problems if you get a good one its a really good phone. The one thing I really enjoyed about it though was for an android phone the better life was the BEST!


I did not buy it from this seller, but I have the htc one x at t, the phone always restart and turn off. I need to be connected all time because I work with gps maps routes, and suddenly restart and that makes me mad for job. The first phone was htc amaze, battery last 4 hours and the phone died I tried to contact HTC and bad support.I wont never trust htc phones again. I will go for sony xperia, samsung or nexus.<br /><br />A 30 dollar phone does much better than those htc crap. Buying htc phones is putting money in the trash.


It was more than old. infact old is an under statement, it was fake.


OK, so while waiting for my new WIN/8 Phone, I thought I would try my first Android phone. I have always like HTC and have found them to be highly reliable.<br /><br />I like this phone a lot. My only problem, which is probably more to do with Android phones or general trends, is that my old SIM card does not fit into this new phone. Instead of choosing to "cut it", I opted for getting a brand new micro-SIM, i.e. two phone numbers now.<br /><br />Once they put out the new WIN/8 phones, I will see if they too use this new micro-SIM format. Or. maybe I will just move to a dual phone setup.


The item came on time as expected and the phone looks and works great. So far, I have no issues with it.


HTC one X is a great device, high performance, great images and videos and good signal reception as well, like the others smartphones the problem is the battery life, but it does its best.
